# tEDS example repo 

If you want to try out tEDS then this is the place to be!

Clone the repo and issue the following commands:

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

You should now have a web interface running on http://localhost:3000.

Try editing `app/worker/src/worker.ts` and see how `app/web/app/page.tsx` responds!
